- Metrics
  - [ ] Comparison to solve/create a grid
  - [ ] number of backtracing
  - Three of my own
    - [ ] Difficulty of the puzzle (ratio of hints)
    - [ ] Difficulty compared to backtracing actions
    - [ ] Time to create grid and solve the grid
  

- User messages
- Iterative output – when a sub-grid level is complete print out the grid as it looks at that point in time (e.g. when creating/solving grid – show grid after rows 1 through 3 have been completed)
- Print final grid (partial for creator/solution for solver)

# Plan

- Create a fully solved grid
- Randomly remove elements from the array
- Export to a file

## Solver
